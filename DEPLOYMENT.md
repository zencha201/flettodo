# FleTodo SPA Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the FleTodo Single Page Application (SPA) that has been built and packaged for web deployment.

## üì¶ What's Been Built

The `/release` directory contains a fully functional SPA with two implementations:

### 1. Standalone HTML/CSS/JavaScript Version (Recommended)
- `index.html` - Main application entry point
- `styles.css` - Beautiful, responsive styling
- `app.js` - Complete todo list functionality
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest for app installation
- `sw.js` - Service worker for offline support
- `README.md` - Detailed documentation

### 2. Flet-Generated Version (Advanced)
- Complete Flet web build with Pyodide runtime
- Includes original Python source code in `app.tar.gz`
- Flutter-based rendering with extensive assets

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Web Hosting (Easiest)

Upload the entire `/release` directory contents to any static hosting service:

**Popular Services:**
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to `gh-pages` branch
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop the folder or connect Git
- **Vercel**: Deploy with Git integration
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use `firebase deploy`
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**: Static website hosting
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Git-based deployment

**Example - GitHub Pages:**
```bash
# From your repository root
git subtree push --prefix release origin gh-pages
```

### Option 2: Traditional Web Server

Configure any web server to serve the static files:

**Apache (.htaccess):**
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L,QSA]
```

**Nginx:**
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Option 3: Local Testing

Use the included test server:
```bash
cd release
python3 test_server.py
```

Or use any simple HTTP server:
```bash
cd release
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading
- Ensure all files are uploaded to the web server
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify HTTPS is used for PWA features

### Data Not Persisting
- Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
- Ensure the app is served from same domain
- Private browsing may limit storage

### Mobile Issues
- Verify responsive meta tag is present
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Check PWA manifest is correctly configured

## üìà Next Steps

After deployment, you can:
1. Monitor usage with web analytics (if desired)
2. Add more features by modifying the JavaScript
3. Customize the design to match your branding
4. Set up automated deployments with CI/CD
